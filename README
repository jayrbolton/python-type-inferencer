Usage
	* jython main.py <source_code.py> The output will go in logs/pytown.log

Structure
	* The main program code is in pytown.py the type objects with methods such as
	  unify, apply_subst, and free_type_vars are in inftype.py
	* builtins.py has some pre-written builtin types and the builtin environment
	* parser.py is the parsing module

	* Unit testing is in tests/. Run them with jython tests/*.py A collection of
	* sample source code we can type-infer is in tests/src/

Todo
	* make sure inference with builtins is working as desired clean up the
	* traverse() method in pytown.py class types more tests?
