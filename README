Usage
	* jython main.py <source_code.py>
	* eg: jython main.py tests/src/functions.py
	* The output will go in logs/pytown.log

Structure
	* The main program code is in pytown.py
	* The type objects with methods such as unify, apply_subst, and
	  free_type_vars are in inftype.py
	* builtins.py has some pre-written builtin types and the builtin environment
	* parser.py is the parsing module

Testing
	* Unit testing is in tests/.
	* Run them all with 'tests/test_all.sh'
	* Run them individually with 'jython tests/something_tests.py'
	* Sample source code we can try type-inferring is in tests/src/

Todo
	* make sure inference with builtins is working as desired
	* clean up the traverse() method in pytown.py
	* class types
	* more tests?
